Extra credit if you identify the web server used by your opponent with a justification.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Attack Tool\r\n-----------\r\nEach Operating System (OS) has unique characteristics in its TCP/IP stack implementation that may serve to identify it on a network. There is a wide range of techniques and methods that helped us get a good estimate of the operating system running on a certain remote machine.\r\n\r\nOne approach is to use active fingerprinting. That is, special “probe” packets are sent to a certain machine, and based on its response, a certain OS is assumed.\r\n\r\nAnother approach is to use passive fingerprinting (as used in our project), where legitimate traffic is analyzed and compared for certain key differences in the TCP/IP stack implementation on different versions and types of operating systems.\r\n\r\nThis tool sends a legitimate HTTP request to the victim’s web server, and based on the response packets, different tests are applied to determine the installed OS and web server.\r\n\r\nA total of ten techniques are used to filter out a final choice from 24 OS Versions. These techniques have different weight values based on their accuracy.\r\n\r\nTechnique | Description | Weight\r\n:---: | :--- | :---:\r\n**TTL** | Test the initial TTL value used by the OS | 0.5\r\n**DF** | Some OSes set the DF bit in the IP header while others don’t | 1\r\n**IP ID** | Different IPIDs may be sent in the IP header | 1\r\n**Window Size** | Differentiate implementations based on default Window Size in TCP | 1\r\n**SYN Packet Size** | May differ between different OSes | 1\r\n**Window Scale Option (TCP)** | Not all OSes implementation use this option | 1\r\n**TCP Options Order** | The order of TCP options may vary from one system to another | 2.5\r\n**ACK Flag** | Differentiate OSes based on the value of the Acknowledgment Number field in the TCP header when the ACK flag is set to zero | 1\r\n**URG flag** | Differentiate OSes based on the value of the Urgent Pointer field in the TCP header when the URG flag is set to zero | 1\r\n**Banner Grabbing** | The HTTP reply from the web server may contain valuable information revealing the web server name and version as well as the OS name in some cases |\r\n\r\nYou can run the attack tool by issuing the following command:\r\n\r\n> ./ofp_tool victim_ip\r\n\r\n## References\r\n----------\r\nImad Elhajj, American University of Beirut, <a href=\"http://staff.aub.edu.lb/~ie05/\" target=\"_new\">More</a>.\r\n",
